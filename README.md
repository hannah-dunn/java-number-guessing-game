## Purpose

-   Small Java project to start off the year, I wanted to refresh myself in Java and using the Eclipse IDE workspace
-   Initially running in the console, with the intention to explore Java GUI

---

## Build Steps

-   how to build / run project
-   use proper code snippets if there are any commands to run

---

## Design Goals / Approach

-   Truly just wanted a function and neat GUI as I haven't worked with this before, totally experimenting here

---

## Features

-   The project random generates a number between 1 and 1000
-   The user is prompted to 'Guess what number I'm thinking:'
-   User types a number and is prompted to guess either a higher or lower number to match the target randomly generated number
-   Upon getting the correct guess, the user is congratulated and the number of guess attempts is listed

---

## Future Goals

-   I'm not sure how to approach it yet but to build on this further a scoreboard system could be cool, listing the fastest guess
-   A smaller addition would be some kind of intro/home screen before the game begins

---

## What did you struggle with?

-   Java GUI is entirely new to me, so the struggle was the uphill walk to learn all this new content
